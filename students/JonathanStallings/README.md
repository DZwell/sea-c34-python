###About Me

Originally from California, I received a BA in Philosophy before moving to Japan and teaching English for five years. After returning to the US, I worked for the English Department at American River College, where I helped coordinate operations and update curriculum for their Writing Center program.

I love exploring new uses of technology to creatively solve problems. Now I hope to expand my toolset by honing some solid coding skills.
