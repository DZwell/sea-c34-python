# 1. What if I put finally in a loop with a break?

while True:
    try:
        x = int(raw_input("Please enter a number: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print "Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again..."
    finally:
        print "Executing finally"

# Answer: finally still ran
# Please enter a number: 10
# Executing finally

# 2. Can I use except more than once? For example, try XX, expect XX,expect XX

try:
    f = open('test.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except IOError as e:
    print "I/O error %s: %s" % (e.errno, e.strerror)
except ValueError:
    print "Could not convert data to an integer."
except:
    print "Unexpected error"
    raise

# Answer: Yes
